Regression Analysis with Python! 

As part of my ongoing journey to deepen my data science and Python skills, I’m thrilled to share a new project I’ve been working on—Regression Analysis with Python!

Project Overview: In this project, I’ve implemented regression models to analyze and predict trends based on historical data. The goal was to understand the relationships between variables and make data-driven predictions.

Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating regression models

Key Insights:
- Implemented Linear and Polynomial regression to predict outcomes from datasets.
- Applied feature scaling, model evaluation techniques, and performance metrics (like R² and Mean Squared Error).
- Learned valuable lessons in data preprocessing and feature selection.



I hope this project will inspire anyone looking to dive into regression analysis or explore data science with Python. Feel free to check out the code, and let me know your thought or any suggestions!
